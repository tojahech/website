# Breads

## Focaccia

Combine the **500g white flour**, **25g yeast**, **1 tablespoon of sugar**, **1/2 cup olive oil** with 350ml of warm water.
Mix into a dough and turn onto a floured surface.
Kneed LOTS until it is smooth and elastic.
(Basically the more kneading the better it tastes, usually 15 minutes suffices.)
Put kneaded mixture in a bowl and allow to rise until it doubles in volume.
Kneed for another 5 minutes and let rise again.

Put on a floured tray and push into shape.
Cover in **salt**, **rosemary** and **olives**.
Cook at 220C for about 15 minutes.
You will know when it is done because the bread sounds hollow when you tap it.

## Hot Cross Buns (Sans Cross)

Combine **14g dry yeast** with **1/4 cup of caster sugar** and **1 1/2 cups warm milk** in a bowl.
Allow it to stand until the mixture is frothy.

In a second bowl, sift **600g plain flour**, **1 teaspoon of mixed spice**, **1 teaspoon of cinnamon**.
Rub in **60 grams of butter** until the mixture is consistent.

Once the yeast is frothy, mix **1 egg**, **1 cup of sultanas** and the yeast mixture into the flour.
Kneed the dough on a floured board until it is silky.
Allow the dough to rise under a tea towel for 45 minutes.

Butter a baking tray and divide the mixture into small buns, placing them on the tray.
Allow it to sit for a further 10 minutes to rise.

Bake in a 220C oven for 20 minutes or until brown.

(The cross is tasteless and pointless, but if you insist, just mix some flour and water into a paste then shape the cross.)

# Puddings

## Custard

(This is a great way to use up the leftover egg yolks from a pavlova.)

The recipe can be made with as many **egg yolks** as you have.
For each egg yolk, add **1/2 cup milk** to a saucepan.
Add **1 teaspoon vanilla extract** and heat until warm to the touch.

Meanwhile whisk the egg yolks.
For each yolk, add **1 level teaspoon cornflour** and **1 heaped teaspoon caster sugar**.

Once the milk is warm, very very gradually pour it into the egg mixture while continuously whisking.
Do this slowly, too quick and the custard will curdle.

Return the custard to the saucepan and cook on a low heat.
Stir the mixture constantly until it thickens.

## Chocolate Pudding

Sift together **1 1/4 cups plain flour**, **1 teaspoon baking powder**, **a pinch of salt**, **3/4 cup sugar** and **1 teaspoon cocoa**.

Pour **2 cups boiling water** over the mixture then bake in an over at 180C for 45 minutes.

## Lemon Delicious Pudding

Cream **30g butter** with **3/4 cup caster sugar**.
Separate the yolk of **2 eggs** and beat them into the creamed butter.
In another bowl, beat the egg whites.
Mix **3 tbsp flour** and **1 cup milk** into the cream and then add the rind and juice of **2 lemons**.
Fold the egg whites into the main mixture.

Pour the pudding into a greased dish.
Put this dish into a second and surround with water.
Bake at 180C for 20 minutes, and then 140C for 25 minutes. ### Date Slice

Finely chop **250g soft dates**.
Mix **100g almond flour**, **100g small walnut pieces** and **1 tablespoon cocoa** in a large bowl.
Stir in the dates, adding **aguave (maple) syrup** to help moisten the mixture.
It's quite hard to stir, so I suggest using your hands.

Press into a tray and refrigerate.

## 'Apple' Crumble

(Feel free to substitute apples for any other fruit.)

To make the topping mix **1 cup sugar**, **1 cup plain flour** and **1 cup dessicated coconut**.
Add **200g melted butter** and stir thoroughly.
