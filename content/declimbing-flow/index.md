title: "Declimbing Flow"
---

This is a short stretching sequence designed to complement regular climbing.
It serves two purposes.
We want to improve flexibility in the lower body to help keep our hips close to the wall and to reach unusual footholds.
We also want to stretch out our upper body to undo some of the abuse caused by years of repeatedly doing the same movements with the same muscles.

## Detailed Instructions

**(Sit)** Begin by sitting cross legged in a comfortable position.

**(Relax and Loosen Up)** We'll begin with a few gentle mobility exercises.
First interlock your thumbs and reach your arms up to the sky, stretching as high as you can.
Feel the movement through your shoulders and then relax.
Move your feet in front of you with bent knees and place your hands behind you with straight arms.
Push your hands into the ground and lift your chest up.
Turn over onto your hands and knees.
From here we will do a few spine and back movements.
First alternate between arching your back on an inhale and compressing your stomach on an exhale.
This is the classic cat-cow movement.
Then bend to the left and look at your hip, trying to bring your left shoulder in the direction of your left hip.
Repeat the same on the other side.
Finally, plant your hands firmly on the floor and rotate your elbows inwards and outwards.
As you do so, feel the movement carry through into your shoulders and back.

**(External rotator stretch)** Lay face down on the floor and extend your right hand out to the side and bring your left hand up as if you were going to do a push up.
Make sure the right arm is straight and have your fingertips line up with your eyes.
Lift your left knee and let it drape over the right side of your body as you push with your left hand to externally rotate the right shoulder.

**(Internal rotator stretch)** As you bring your left leg back over your body bring it up on the left side perpendicular to your hips with a bent knee.
Push off the ground with both hands and bring your left arm under your chest.
Gently lower down to internally rotate the left shoulder.

Repeat these two stretches on the other side.

**(Downward dog)** Push up and transition into a downward dog.
Let your knees bend and focus on stretching the shoulders.
You may find that it helps to contract your upper back similarly to how you'd do a scapular pull-up.

**(Deep squat)** Rock forward into a plank position and bring your right foot up, placing it just outside your hands.
Lower your left knee to the ground and slide the left leg as far back as you can while keeping the right shin vertical.
Fix the ball of your left foot on the ground and attempt to straighten the left leg while keeping your hips in their current position.

**(Forward bend)** Lower your left knee to the ground and rock back onto your heel.
Straighten your right leg, keep your hips square, and lean your body forwards.
Make sure to lean at the hips rather than bending your back.

Repeat these two stretches on the other side of the body.

**(Pigeon)** Return to a plank position and lower your right leg to the ground with your knee bent 90 degrees.
Hold your foot with your left hand and lay the back leg straight out behind you.
To stretch, rotate your hip down to the ground.

**(Side bend)** Bring your left leg to the front and stretch in out straight, tuck your right foot to your groin.
Lock your left elbow inside your left knee and bend sideways, reaching out to your left foot with your right hand.

Repeat these two stretches on the other side of the body.

**(Pancake)** Center your body and stretch out both legs in front of you.
Spread your legs and bend forwards at the hips.

**(Kneeling knees apart)** Cross your legs and roll forwards so that you're on your hands and knees.
Place your forearms flat on the ground and lean forwards until your hips are just in front of your knees.
Spread your knees apart as far as you can while keeping your lower legs parallel.
Stretch by leaning your hips back.

**(Wrists)** Sit back onto your heels.
Lean forwards, make fists and place the backs of your hands flat on the ground.
Gently lean backwards to stretch your wrists.
The further forwards you place your hands the more intense the stretch will be.
Lean forwards again and this time place your open palms flat on the ground with fingers pointing behind you.
Lean backwards to stretch your wrists the other way.

**(Neck sequence)** Return to sitting on you heels and make sure to sit upright with good posture.
Lower your head and bring your chin to your chest to feel a stretch in the back of your neck.
Then raise your head and look to the sky.
Make sure to keep your mouth closed otherwise you won't feel a stretch.
Return your head to a neutral position and then pivot your head to look to your left and then to your right.
Come back to the center and then tilt your head to the left and then the right.
Imagine lowering your ear to your shoulder.

**(Sit)** Sit and relax for a few moments before going about your day.
