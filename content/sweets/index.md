## Breads

### Focaccia

Combine the **500g white flour**, **25g yeast**, **1 tablespoon of sugar**, **1/2 cup olive oil** with 350ml of warm water.
Mix into a dough and turn onto a floured surface.
Kneed LOTS until it is smooth and elastic. 
(Basically the more kneading the better it tastes, usually 15 minutes suffices.)
Put kneaded mixture in a bowl and allow to rise until it doubles in volume.
Kneed for another 5 minutes and let rise again.

Put on a floured tray and push into shape. 
Cover in **salt**, **rosemary** and **olives**.
Cook at 220C for about 15 minutes. 
You will know when it is done because the bread sounds hollow when you tap it.


### Hot Cross Buns (Sans Cross)

Combine **14g dry yeast** with **1/4 cup of caster sugar** and **1 1/2 cups warm milk** in a bowl. 
Allow it to stand until the mixture is frothy. 

In a second bowl, sift **600g plain flour**, **1 teaspoon of mixed spice**, **1 teaspoon of cinnamon**. 
Rub in **60 grams of butter** until the mixture is consistent. 

Once the yeast is frothy, mix **1 egg**, **1 cup of sultanas** and the yeast mixture into the flour. 
Kneed the dough on a floured board until it is silky. 
Allow the dough to rise under a tea towel for 45 minutes. 

Butter a baking tray and divide the mixture into small buns, placing them on the tray. 
Allow it to sit for a further 10 minutes to rise. 

Bake in a 220C oven for 20 minutes or until brown. 

(The cross is tasteless and pointless, but if you insist, just mix some flour and water into a paste then shape the cross.)

## Desserts

### Annie's Pavlova

Separate the whites of **5 eggs** into a stainless steel or glass bowl. 
Yes, the material is important!
Using an electric hand beater, whip the egg whites on slowest speed until bubbles appear then beat of the fastest speed. 
When the eggs are stiff gradually add **1 1/4 cups of caster sugar**, a quarter of a cup at a time. 
Continue beating until the mixture is very stiff. 
Add **1 teaspoon of vanilla extract** and **1 teaspoon of white vinegar** and continue beating. 

Place the mixture onto a piece of baking paper on a flat tray and shape into a low cylinder.

Remove from the oven and flip onto a plate to cool.

One **400ml can black beans**, **2 tbsp cocoa powder**, **1/2 cup oats**, **1 tsp salt**, **1/3 cup maple syrup, agave or honey**, **1/4 cup coconut oil**, **2 tsp vanilla extract** and **1/2 tsp baking powder**. 
After the mixture is blended, mix in **1/2 cup chocolate chips**. 

Pour the mixture into a tin lined with baking paper and bake at 180C for 18 minutes. 




## Puddings

### Custard

(This is a great way to use up the leftover egg yolks from a pavlova.)

The recipe can be made with as many **egg yolks** as you have. 
For each egg yolk, add **1/2 cup milk** to a saucepan. 
Add **1 teaspoon vanilla extract** and heat until warm to the touch. 

Meanwhile whisk the egg yolks. 
For each yolk, add **1 level teaspoon cornflour** and **1 heaped teaspoon caster sugar**. 

Once the milk is warm, very very gradually pour it into the egg mixture while continuously whisking. 
Do this slowly, too quick and the custard will curdle. 

Return the custard to the saucepan and cook on a low heat. 
Stir the mixture constantly until it thickens. 


### Chocolate Pudding

Sift together **1 1/4 cups plain flour**, **1 teaspoon baking powder**, **a pinch of salt**, **3/4 cup sugar** and **1 teaspoon cocoa**. 
Mix **1/2 cup milk** and **90g melted butter** then stir together with the dry ingredients. 

Place in a baking dish/tray or divide the mixture into (four) individual coffee mugs. 

Mix **1/2 cup sugar**, **1/4 cup coconut** and **1 desert spoon cocoa** then sprinkle over the top of the wet mixture. 
Pour **2 cups boiling water** over the mixture then bake in an over at 180C for 45 minutes. 


### Lemon Delicious Pudding

Cream **30g butter** with **3/4 cup caster sugar**. 
Separate the yolk of **2 eggs** and beat them into the creamed butter. 
In another bowl, beat the egg whites. 
Mix **3 tbsp flour** and **1 cup milk** into the cream and then add the rind and juice of **2 lemons**. 
Fold the egg whites into the main mixture. 

Pour the pudding into a greased dish. 
Put this dish into a second and surround with water. 
Bake at 180C for 20 minutes, and then 140C for 25 minutes. ### Date Slice

Finely chop **250g soft dates**. 
Mix **100g almond flour**, **100g small walnut pieces** and **1 tablespoon cocoa** in a large bowl. 
Stir in the dates, adding **aguave (maple) syrup** to help moisten the mixture. 
It's quite hard to stir, so I suggest using your hands. 

Press into a tray and refrigerate. 


### 'Apple' Crumble

(Feel free to substitute apples for any other fruit.)

To make the topping mix **1 cup sugar**, **1 cup plain flour** and **1 cup dessicated coconut**. 
Add **200g melted butter** and stir thoroughly. 

Put **2 cans of tinned apples** in a baking dish and cover with the topping. 
Sprinkle with **cinnamon**. 

Cook at 180C for 30 to 45 minutes.
