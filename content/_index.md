## Climbing

Minimalist maps and topos of some climbing areas around Brisbane.

A few designs for climbing gear. 
Note that none of these are safety equipment where you'd really want to see a whole bunch of tests before trusting your life to them. 
Instead they're designs for climbing accessories, chalk bags and the like.

- [Chalk Bag](/chalk-bag/)
- [Infinity Clip - Stick Clipping Tool](/stick-clip/)

These notes concern safety and so should be taken with a large grain of salt. 
While I trust my own reasoning, no-one else should. 
With all climbing safety advice you should think through what's being said and verify it yourself.

To counteract the abuse climbing does to my body I've also put a bit of thought (and practice) into stretching and mobility work.

## Textiles and Design

Outdoor equipment is frequently made by small cottage manufactures and by individuals. 
Tend to use the term MYOG for 'make your own gear'. 
The main reason all these smaller operations don't get outcompeted is that enthusiasts are typically more willing to accept tradeoffs and skill requirements than the general public. 
Here are some of my designs. 

- [Pyramid Tent](/pyramid-tent/)
- [Bug Bivy](/bug-bivy/)
- [Pillowcase Stuff-sacks](/pillowcase-stuff-sack/)
- [Hammock Bag](/hammock-bag/)
- [Hidden Knot Huaraches](/huarache-knot/)

## Hiking / Tramping

Although I'm loath to give general advice, here are a few bits of info about hiking that have worked well for me. 

- [Three Bag Packing System](/three-bags/)
- [Minimised Te Araroa GPS Track](/ta-minimised/)
- [Mt Beerwah East Face Track](/beerwah-east/)



## Maths

For posterities sake, here are copies of my honours and masters theses. 
Both projects were engrossing and I was lucky enough to discover some minor results in each.
