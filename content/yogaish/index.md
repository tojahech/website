This smooth flowing sequence of stretches inspired by yoga is intended to improve flexibility for the whole body.
My focus is on flexibility for rock climbing, but the routine is general enough for anyone.
It flows together so beautifully you can turn your brain off and let your chattering thoughts momentarily subside.

## Rationale

With stretching, as with anything, I find it easy to get lost in a cycle chasing the perfect exercise.
New shiny exercises turn up with enough regularity that nothing specific ever sticks.
It's the classic paralysis of analysis.

This route is designed to be 'good enough'.
It covers most of the body, can be done without equipment and most importantly has 'flow'.
You can turn your brain off and just follow the movements.

## Contract-Relax Stretching

The stretches can be done however but the 'best' way is contract-relax stretching.
The basic idea is simple.
As you stretch you're trying to relax and lengthen your muscles.
To aid in this we can do the opposite.
Keep your body in the same position and tense the muscle that's being lengthened against the stretch.
After a gentle contraction, relax the muscle and use the resulting reaction to sink further into the stretch.

The expert to read from here is Kit Laughlin, in particular his book.

Tips

- If you can't focus on the muscle that's stretching, squeezing your butt often helps as a trigger.
- You don't need huge contractions, squeeze gently.
- Don't leave a stretch by pulling with the muscle that's stretching. Eg, forward bend, don't pull yourself back upright, instead bend the knees to break the stretch and then stand. Pulling with the muscle that's just been stretched is risking injury.
- Move with your breathing. Transition between stretches on an inhale, use the exhale to relax and sink into the stretch. Same thing with contract/relax cycles, inhale for the contraction and exhale for the relaxation.
