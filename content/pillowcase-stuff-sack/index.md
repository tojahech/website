# Pillowcase Stuff-sack

This isn't really a novel design I'm sharing here, it's a bloody pillow case. 
Instead I'll do a little evangelising for some gear I don't often see people using. 
Pillowcase stuff-sacks are amazing. 
They're lighter than a drawstring bag, have no rope to fiddle with and keep their contents compressed.
